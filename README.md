8️⃣ AI-Powered Antibiotic Usage & Resistance Tracking System
Description:
Develop an AI-driven system to monitor, analyze, and optimize antibiotic usage across patients and healthcare settings. The project will combine multiple AI tools to track prescription patterns, detect misuse or overuse, and identify early signals of antibiotic resistance using clinical data and treatment history.

The system aims to support clinicians and healthcare administrators in promoting responsible antibiotic use and improving patient outcomes.

Expected Outcomes:

Antibiotic prescription tracking and analytics module

ML models to detect high-risk or irrational antibiotic usage

Rule-based + AI alerts for potential resistance patterns

Visualization dashboard for trends and insights
